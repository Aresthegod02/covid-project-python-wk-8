# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A data analysis and visualization project that explores global COVID-19 trends using real-world data. This notebook analyzes confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations across multiple countries and over time.

## Project Objectives

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data from Our World in Data
- Analyze trends in total cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time
- Compare COVID-19 metrics across selected countries
- Create visualizations to highlight patterns and changes
- Present findings clearly using a combination of code, charts, and narrative

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly (for interactive choropleth maps)
- CSV dataset: [Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv)

## How to Run This Project

1. **Clone the repository or download the project files**

2. **Install the required libraries**  
   Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

3. **Download the dataset**  
Download `owid-covid-data.csv` from [this link](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv) and place it in the project directory.

4. **Launch the Jupyter Notebook**
Open the notebook file (e.g., `covid19_data_tracker.ipynb`) and run the cells step-by-step.

## Key Insights and Reflections

- The United States and India consistently show the highest total case numbers among the selected countries.
- The United Kingdom showed early acceleration in vaccination rollout.
- Death rates decreased as vaccinations increased, suggesting a positive correlation between vaccine coverage and reduced fatality.
- Visualizing trends over time offers a clearer view of pandemic waves and response efficiency.
- Cleaning real-world datasets is often the most time-consuming but necessary part of the process.
